        <p> <b>Gta interdiction server is the first Arabian server of its kind that relies primarily

            on gameplay similar to FIVE M,<br> after developing its own SAMP and data.<br> The

            Gta interdiction server also includes a more realistic gameplay than any other Arabian server SAMP

            server. <br>For example, when buying a car, forget about it disappearing from the

            garage, as is the traditional way.<br> You have to go to the garage to remove it here in   

            the Gta interdiction Server.<br> A second idea: once you buying the car, you must maintain it

            and use it properly,<br> because it will remain in the city when you leave SAMP</b> </p>
